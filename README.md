# Marker Loci Identification and Primer Design Tool

This tool aims to find a minimal set of reliable markers for identification of given target species. Optionally, for each target species, a list of non-target closely related species may be specified.

The marker regions are searched for within single-copy core genes only.

1. Pan-genome analysis

Input genomes are annotated using Prokka (Seemann, 2014) and core genes are identified with Panaroo (Tonkin-Hill, 2020). Annotated sequences are saved to a local PostgreSQL database. Single-copy core genes are then queried from this database and saved in the multi-FASTA format.

2. Multiple sequence alignment

Single copy core genes are aligned using one of the following algorithms:

* ClustalW
* MUSCLE
* MAFFT
* probabilistic multiple alignment program PRANK (LÃ¶ytynoja, 2014)

3. Identification of conserved regions

Identification of conserved regions for each species can be carried out by means of:
* Consensus sequence
* Shannon's entropy
* Quasi-alignment-based method proposed by Nagar & Hahsler (2013)

After finding species-specific marker regions, a coverage matrix is created showing which of the found markers can be used to reliably identify which of the target isolates. Based on this matrix, a minimal set of marker regions is selected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- External tools: Prokka, Panaroo, ClustalW, MUSCLE, MAFFT, PRANK, Minimap2, Primer3 (if using default primer design algorithm)
- A reference database compatible with Minimap2 for sequence alignment

## Usage

```bash
python marker_primer_tool.py [options]
